## Wiser Login Challenge

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

To run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Production environment

Open [https://wiser-login-challenge.vercel.app/](https://wiser-login-challenge.vercel.app/) to navigate.

This app is a login screen, you need to put your e-mail and password credentials to get logged in.

There are two responses for this request, a success response and an error response,
the success response is set when both credentials are correct, the correct credentials are listed below:

```
  {
    username: "wiser@mail.com",
    password: "123456",
  },
  {
    username: "vini@mail.com",
    password: "654321",
  }
```

Anything different from that will return invalid credentials message. Both success and failure will be displayed as an alert.

## Functionalities

I chose to make the API inside the project as a page route because I had more freedom
to customize the response, I tried to use MockApi, Mockable, Designer.Mocky and even JSON Server,
but none of them let me work freely as I wanted. But the flow is working perfectly!

I separated the pages and templates to let the pages handle the data flow and handling,
and the templates handle only render.

The company that I work nowadays uses the duck pattern with redux, I tried a different
approach so I can see another way to use Redux.
